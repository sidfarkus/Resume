## Background

I have been developing software on some level for 15 years with a focus on computer graphics, image processing, programming languages, and high performance computing.  I like to get involved in the community and am an active member of the DC Ruby User's Group, Polyglot Programmer's meetup and attend CMAP's GiveCamp every year to code for charities and nonprofits.

## Education

Computer Science, B.S.  
University of Maryland, Baltimore County
2001 - 2009

## Proficiency

I started writing code when I was 12 in QBasic and grew my skills from there.  I actively use (J)Ruby, C# and Java in my day-to-day coding and experiment with my own language Mountain as well as functional languages like Scala, Haskell, and Clojure.

I have worked on the client side as well as the server and am deeply familiar with frameworks and libraries on both ends.  I have extensive experience with jQuery on the client side but also some MV* client side frameworks such as Knockout, Ember and Angular.js. On the server side I've used Rails, ASP.NET MVC(3/4), Oracle 11g, PostgreSQL, Apache Accumulo, Solr, Redis, Elasticsearch, and MongoDB extensively.

## Experience

### LearnZillion

#### Senior Software Engineer - September 2014 to Present

Writing full stack code for a Ruby on Rails 4 site http://learnzillion.com with millions of pageviews/month.  Front end work includes Angular.js and Knockout views integrated with a classic server-side rendered templates. Back end work is centered around Postgres with Elasticsearch and Redis for search/queuing as appropriate. 

### 42six Solutions (purchased by CSC)

#### Technical Lead - January 2012 to September 2014

I wrote a JRuby + Java ORM for Apache Accumulo to provide advanced query support in a JRuby on Rails web app. I then assisted and took over as technical lead of the team creating the web app.  I introduced Knockout as a way to remove much of the jQuery code littering the app as well.  I was then technical lead of a 6 person team writing  services for a distributed cloud architecture exposing PostgreSQL, Mongo, Accumulo, and Cloudera Impala over Apache Thrift.

### Northrop Grumman Information Systems

#### Radar Software Developer - May 2009 to July 2012

I assisted with creating a Synthetic Aperture Rader advanced imagery exploitation tool using C#, C++, and OpenGL.  I wrote implementations of several image processing algorithms to be used by the tool such as entropy autofocus, image convolution, and geospatial mosaicking of multiple images.  I was also involved with research into GPGPU computing implementing time domain backprojection using CUDA and Python.  I wrote http://www.pgatlas.com for the MNCPPC using Silverlight, ASP.NET MVC and Oracle.

### Johns Hopkins APL

#### Software Development Intern - May 2003 to August 2004

Wrote Tomahawk missile communications scheduling algorithms using C#.
